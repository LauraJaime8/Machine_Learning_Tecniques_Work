# Activity 5. Feature Engineering

## 1.- Load the data
For this activity, the whole data set has been used (both San Juan and Iquitos cities). The final data has been stored into a separated data frames to study the PCA (and remove outliers)
and the correlation between features. 

## 2.- Remove outliers.
Outliers from both cities has been deleted by doing a normalization of the data and the plotting the PCA.

## 3.- Study the correlation.
Looking at the resulting correlation graphs, a set of features from each city can be extracted.
