# Machine Learning Techniques Work: Prediction of dengue fever.
Repository for the classwork of Machine Learning Techniques subject.

The objetive of this project is to perform a prediction about the Dengue fever in the cities of San Juan and Iquitos.

The Dengue fever is a disease which is usual in tropical parts of the world, like the cities mentioned before. The appearance of this desease is related with the climate of these parts, specially the temperature and precipitation, which are features that are used in the project in order to make the prediction.

The development of the project is organized with different activities, each one focused in several types of techniques. The purpose is to learn from the basic to more advanced techniques.

In the end, the prediction will be used to compete in the Driven Data Competition "DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread".
